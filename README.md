# Harmony Regridding Service

This repository contains the source code, unit test suite, Jupyter notebook
documentation and build-related scripts for the Harmony Regridding Service. The
initial version of this service will perform regridding only, for collections
with one geographic grid to another geographic grid, in support of the GES DISC
GPM/IMERGHH and MERRA collections.
