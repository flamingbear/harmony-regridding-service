## v0.0.0
### 2023-01-26

This initial version of the Harmony Regridding service sets up the core
infrastructure required for a backend service. It contains a HarmonyAdapter
class that can be invoked within a Harmony Kubernetes cluster, and will return
the input granule without any transformation. The service itself will be
implemented in future tickets.
